Hello and Good Day to Whatsapp Team.

I am unable to log in my account in WhatsApp business, due to it mentioning 'You need the official WhatsApp to log in'. to which I am using the official version downloaded from the play store. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling, log in using the same number and it wouldnt work, i had this number for a long time. 

I hope it could be resolved. It'd be quite unfortunate if i can't log in due to these arbitrary bug/error.
