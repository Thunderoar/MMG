2) queueing system.

problem with current method of pen and paper
----------------------------
ive been to talk 2 times, and one thing for sure is


LONG QUEUE.
where the entrance?

calling system.
because what i see now is that, the leader would have to notify if they're done, why not just use tick system. for the attendees(no login), and have been interviewed(requires login).


knowing who are their invited speaker. prefill method
oftentimes, we are the one that needed to search who their invited speaker is.


the message are loss/hard to find/no form at all.
referral method. would be good


dorang tak tahu nombor penjaga. prefill method

international method?

untick for mistake


what if everyone can access that site to tick their attendance.
what would be the verification?

-----------------------------

the advantage of prefill method
dorang just cari nama dorang ADA
nom fon pun dah ada ADA
nom penjaga pun dah ada ADA
kehadiran bersama, PILIH ADA
pegawai jemputan, ADA, OVERRIDE

more efficient in big talk


the problem lies within the google form.
